# ðŸ”¤ C++ String Utilities

Welcome! This is a small collection of **string utility functions** written in **C++** as part of my learning journey as a **first-year Computer Science student**.

These functions helped me practice:
-  Writing and calling functions
-  Using return values
-  Loops and logic
-  Header files & implementation files
-  Structuring projects like a real developer
-  Git & GitHub ðŸš€
-  NameSpace

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside

| Function                            | Description                                        |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `power_function(int, int)`          | Calculates the result of raising a number to a power |
| `count_chars(std::string)`          | Counts how many characters are in a string         |
| `count_charecter(char, std::string)`| Counts how many times a specific character appears |
| `reversed(std::string)`             | Returns a reversed version of the string           |
| `check_string_is_same_backwards(std::string phrase)`  | Checks if a string is a palindrome                 |

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

Make sure to include the `functions.h` header and compile both `.cpp` files:

```bash
g++ *.cpp -o functions
./functions
